# Hostel Utility App
## Complaint Management and Information distribution platform

## Overview
We were asked to design an **Android App** that would allow college students and faculty to register complaints at the **Individual level** or at the **Hostel level** . The frontend was developed using **Android Studios** and the backend is made using **Firebase** api. The frontend and backend communicate using the help of API calls.
